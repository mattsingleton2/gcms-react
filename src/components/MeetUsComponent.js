                  Sarah is a new developer whose excited to start on her front
                  end journey. After starting her career path in Quality
                  Assurance for a ticketing software solution and getting to dip
                  her feet in the development world, she fell in love with the
                  creative aspect that came with being a front end developer.
                  Her dream is to become a UI/UX designer. Dream job aside, she
                  is an avid animal lover with three very mischievious dogs and
                  a very sassy baby pet snake named Neville. She also found a
                  passion for reading at a young age. The idea of being able to
                  adventure new worlds, meet many unique characters, without
                  even leaving the comfort of your living room quickly became an
                  obession. That is probably where her love for MMO's came from,
                  as she is currently leveling her shamen Vulpera on WoW.
